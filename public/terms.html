  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

  <p>By using The Seer ("the app", "the service") at theseer.xyz, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the service.</p>

  <h2>1. Entertainment only</h2>
  <p>The Seer is an astrology-based entertainment application. It combines astronomical calculations with AI-generated text to produce readings. All readings, insights, and content are provided strictly for entertainment and personal reflection purposes only. They are not predictions, guarantees, or statements of fact about your past, present, or future.</p>

  <h2>2. Not professional advice</h2>
  <p>The Seer does not provide and is not a substitute for medical, psychological, psychiatric, legal, financial, or any other professional advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Do not make important life decisions based on readings from this app. If you need professional guidance, consult a qualified, licensed professional in the relevant field.</p>

  <h2>3. AI-generated content</h2>
  <p>All readings are generated using artificial intelligence (OpenAI) combined with astronomical data (Swiss Ephemeris). AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or not applicable to your specific situation. You should evaluate all readings yourself and understand that they do not reflect objective truth. The Seer is an AI system, not a human astrologer.</p>

  <h2>4. Age requirement</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use The Seer. By using the service, you confirm that you are 18 or older. If we learn that someone under 18 is using the service, we reserve the right to restrict access.</p>

  <h2>5. Emotionally sensitive content</h2>
  <p>Readings may include content that you find challenging, negative, or emotionally difficult. Astrological interpretations sometimes reference difficult life themes such as loss, conflict, or endings. These reflect interpretive patterns based on planetary positions — they are not facts about your future, your relationships, or your worth as a person.</p>
