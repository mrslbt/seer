  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

  <p>By using The Seer ("the app") at theseer.xyz, you agree to these terms.</p>

  <h2>1. What The Seer is</h2>
  <p>The Seer is an astrology-based entertainment application. It combines astronomical calculations with AI-generated text to produce readings. Readings are for entertainment and self-reflection purposes only.</p>

  <h2>2. Not professional advice</h2>
  <p>The Seer does not provide medical, psychological, psychiatric, legal, financial, or any other professional advice. Do not make important life decisions based solely on readings from this app. If you need professional guidance, consult a qualified, licensed professional.</p>

  <h2>3. AI-generated content</h2>
  <p>Readings are generated using artificial intelligence (OpenAI) combined with astronomical data (Swiss Ephemeris). AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or not applicable to your specific situation. You should evaluate all readings yourself and not treat them as factual predictions about your life.</p>

  <h2>4. Emotionally sensitive content</h2>
  <p>Readings may include content that you find challenging, negative, or emotionally difficult. Astrological readings sometimes reference difficult themes. These reflect interpretive patterns, not facts about your future or your worth.</p>
  <p>If you are in crisis, thinking about suicide, or feel you may be a danger to yourself or others, please contact emergency services immediately:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline</strong> — Call or text 988 (US)</li>
    <li><strong>Crisis Text Line</strong> — Text HOME to 741741</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency services</strong> — Call 911 (US) or your local emergency number</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your data</h2>
  <p>Your birth data and readings are stored locally in your browser. You are responsible for your own data. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

  <h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the app to harm, harass, or mislead others</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, scrape, or abuse the service</li>
    <li>Overload the service with automated requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Service availability</h2>
  <p>The Seer is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time without notice.</p>

  <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>The Seer's design, code, and branding are our property. Your readings are generated for your personal use. You may share individual readings but may not systematically reproduce or redistribute the service.</p>

  <h2>9. Assumption of risk</h2>
  <p>You use The Seer at your own risk and by your own free and voluntary choice. You acknowledge that readings may contain content you find upsetting or disagree with. You are solely responsible for any actions you take or refrain from taking as a result of readings received through this service.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, The Seer and its operators disclaim all responsibility for any liability, loss, or risk incurred as a consequence, directly or indirectly, of the use of the service, including any actions you take or refrain from taking as a result of readings or information you receive. Our total liability shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100).</p>

  <h2>11. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
